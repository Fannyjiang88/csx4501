This is Fanny Jiang. I'm excited about learning the cutting edge technology from our awesome Professor Ben.

Although I have little experience to most of the software, I'm looking forward to learning them, hoping to harness soon. 

This is the data science class that I am eager to master, utilizing historical data to discover the trends and predict the future. 

I'm looking forward to convert my current data set and able to do data analysis freely. 

Sounds fun? I'm very motivated to push myself out of the comfort zone and roll my sleeves up, get things going!

I'm committed to be your supportive classmate. Your success in this class is important to me. I hope you are with me and also excited for my project!ðŸ˜†
