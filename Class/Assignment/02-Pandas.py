# Pandas data-manipulation capabilities are built on top of NumPy, utilizing its fast array processing, and its graphing capabilities are built on top of Matplotlib.
# 
# * "pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language."
# 
# * It may be one of the most widely used tools for data munging
# 
#   * present data in nice formats
#   * multiple convenient methods for filtering data
#   * work with a variety of data formats (CSV, Excel, â€¦)
#   * convenient functions for quickly plotting data
# 
# * The name comes from panel data (and is also a play on python data analysis)

import pandas as pd


# We need to set up the Pandas basics before getting into the data viz.

# ## Getting your data into Python

# Pandas can be used to easily import a wide variety of file types.

# We already saw an example of this last week:

# In[ ]:


classics_df = pd.read_csv('classics.csv')


# This week we'll use a different dataset called Anscombe's quartet.

# In[ ]:


anscombe_df = pd.read_csv('anscombe.csv')


# In[ ]:


anscombe_df


# ## Making a new dataframe

# We don't just have to import data to make a new dataframe, we can use our existing data structures.

# Let's do this for the MLK data

# In[ ]:


# This was our previous code to get the dictionaries holding the words and word counts:

with open('i-have-a-dream.txt','r') as f:
    speech = f.read()

specialchars = '.,-!:'
for c in specialchars:
    speech = speech.replace(c,' ')

speech = speech.lower()
    
speechwordcount = {}
speechwords = speech.split(' ')
for c in speechwords:
    if c in speechwordcount.keys():
        speechwordcount[c] += 1
    else:
        speechwordcount[c] = 1        


# In[ ]:


print(speechwordcount)


# Let's generate two lists for words and word counts

# In[ ]:


w = []
c = []
for key,val in speechwordcount.items():
    w.append(key)
    c.append(val)    


# In[ ]:


print(w)
print(c)


# For a dictionary with keys and values we can create a new DataFrame with
# 
# `df = pd.DataFrame(dictvariable)`
# 
# The keys will become the column labels, and the values will become the records

# In[ ]:


a = {"A": [1,2,3],
     "B": ['anne','ben','carrie']
    }

a_df = pd.DataFrame(a)

print(a_df)


# In[ ]:


# Let's do this with the speech

s = {'word':w,
     'count':c
    }

df = pd.DataFrame(s)


# In[ ]:


df


# ## Basic information about the dataframe

# It can be vital to do a little data exploration to see what's in your dataframe.
# 
# `head(n)` will allow you to look at the first n rows (5 by default)

# In[ ]:


df.head()


# In[ ]:


df.head(2)


# Similarly, `tail(n)` will allow you to look at the last n rows (5 by default)

# In[ ]:


df.tail()


# There are several other useful dataframe attributes and methods that will allow you to get summary info:
# * `columns` : column names
# * `dtypes` : data types of the columns (dataframes can hold different datatypes in different columns
# * `index` : information about the row indices (they don't have to be numerical)
# * `shape` : the size of the dataframe in each dimension
# * `info()` : a range of summary info that includes the above
# * `describe()` : basic statistics about the data columns

# In[ ]:


df.columns


# In[ ]:


df.dtypes


# In[ ]:


df.index


# In[ ]:


df.shape


# In[ ]:


df.info()


# In[ ]:


df.describe()


# In[ ]:


df.describe(include='all')


# ## Viewing data

# In[ ]:


df


# We can look at a specific column of a dataframe with `df[columnname]`

# In[ ]:


df['word']


# One must be careful with indexing elements in a dataframe.  They have both numerical- and label-based indices, but there are specific rules about how to retrieve values

# In[ ]:


# This will give an error!
df[0]


# In[ ]:


# this will not
df[0:1]


# It's best to stick with `loc` and `iloc` for the moment to index dataframes.
# * `loc` : label-based indexing (which can look numerical if the row index, for example, is a number
# * `iloc` : numerical indexing

# In[ ]:


# the first row
df.loc[0]


# In[ ]:


# the first row, returned as a dataframe
df.loc[[0]]


# In[ ]:


# the first two rows
df.loc[[0,1]]


# In[ ]:


# indexing both the row and column
df.loc[0,'word']


# In[ ]:


# indexing both the row and column
# and returning a dataframe
df.loc[[0],['word']]


# In[ ]:


# you can use lists for the indices
df.loc[[0],['word','count']]


# In[ ]:


df.loc[[10],['word','count']]


# `iloc` is useful when you instead want to index numerically

# In[ ]:


df.iloc[0]


# In[ ]:


df.iloc[1]


# In[ ]:


df.iloc[[1]]


# In[ ]:


df.iloc[0:1]


# In[ ]:


df.iloc[0:4]


# In[ ]:


# this will give an error! you can't use a label-based index like 'word' with iloc
df.iloc[0:4,'word']


# In[ ]:


# instead of referncing the column with 'word'
# iloc indexes it numerically
df.iloc[0:4,0]


# In[ ]:


df.iloc[[0,1,2,3],[0]]


# In[ ]:


df.iloc[0,0]


# In[ ]:


df.loc[0,'word']


# ## Where's the row for "dream"?  Boolean indexing

# It is useful to be able to get elements where certain conditions are true.
# 
# Like here, we may want to get the word count for 'dream'.  Or the word count for every word that contains 'spirit' as a substring.

# This can be accomplished with boolean indexing, where the index is a True/False condition, and there is one such value for every row.

# The following sets up the boolean series of True/False values for every row.

# In[ ]:


df['word'] == 'five'


# We can use that as the index to df, i.e., `df[condition]` to get only those rows where `condition` is True

# In[ ]:


df[df['word'] == 'five']


# It also works as the index when using `loc`

# In[ ]:


df.loc[df['word'] == 'five']


# In[ ]:


df.loc[df['word'] == 'dream']


# In[ ]:


df.loc[df['word'] == 'dream','count']


# In[ ]:


df['word'].str.startswith('d')


# In[ ]:


df.loc[df['word'].str.startswith('d')]


# In[ ]:


df.loc[df['word'].str.contains('we')]


# A brief hint at how easy it is to make plots:

# In[ ]:


df.loc[df['word'].str.contains('we')].plot(kind='bar',x='word')


# In[ ]:


a = df.loc[df['word'].str.contains('we')]


# In[ ]:


a.plot()


# But I digress.
# 
# Dataframes have some very useful methods.
# 
# `sort_values` is one where we can sort all the rows by the values in one particular column.  We can therefore see more easily what the most frequently occurring words are.

# In[ ]:


a.sort_values(by='count')


# In[ ]:


a.sort_values(by='count',ascending=False)


# In[ ]:


df = df.sort_values(by='count', ascending=False)


# In[ ]:


df


# We may revisit cleaning data later... here is an example where we may want to get rid of the first row, which here has index `4`

# In[ ]:


df.drop(4)


# Let's check to make sure it was dropped.

# In[ ]:


df


# No!  What happened?
# 
# `drop` returns a dataframe with the row dropped, but it doesn't change the values of the underlying dataframe.
# 
# You can either reassign the returned value to the dataframe, or use `inplace=True`

# In[ ]:


df.drop(4, inplace=True)


# In[ ]:


df


# ## Saving!
# 
# Let's do one final thing and save the dataframe to use in our later notebook.  
# 
# Pandas allows us to do that very easily with a variety of output formats.  Here is an example to write the `df` dataframe to a csv file.  We include `index=False` so that the indices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...) are not also written to the csv file.

# In[ ]:


df.to_csv('dreamspeechpd.csv', index=False)
